        "\n",
        "Imitation learning (IL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to perform a task by observing demonstrations from an expert. It contrasts with reinforcement learning, where the agent learns through trial and error. Imitation learning is particularly useful in scenarios where defining a reward function is difficult, but expert demonstrations are available.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expert Demonstrations**: Sequences of state-action pairs $(s, a)$ generated by an expert.\n",
        "2. **Policy**: A mapping from states to actions, usually denoted as $\\pi(a|s)$, which represents the probability of taking action $a$ given state $s$.\n",
        "3. **State Space ($\\mathcal{S}$)**: The set of all possible states.\n",
        "4. **Action Space ($\\mathcal{A}$)**: The set of all possible actions.\n",
        "5. **Trajectory**: A sequence of states and actions $\\tau = (s_1, a_1, s_2, a_2, \\ldots, s_T, a_T)$.\n",

        "## Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of imitation learning is to find a policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ parameterized by $\\theta$ that mimics the expert's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a set of expert demonstrations $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\tau_1, \\tau_2, \\ldots, \\tau_N\\}$, where each trajectory $\\tau_i = (s_1^i, a_1^i, s_2^i, a_2^i, \\ldots, s_{T_i}^i, a_{T_i}^i)$, we aim to minimize the difference between the agent's behavior and the expert's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Behavioral Cloning\n",
        "\n",
        "Behavioral cloning (BC) is a supervised learning approach where the policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)$ is trained to directly match the actions taken by the expert in given states.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective function for behavioral cloning is:\n",

        "\n",
        "DAgger is an iterative algorithm that alternates between collecting data from the learned policy and querying the expert for corrections. It addresses the issue of compounding errors in behavioral cloning.\n",

        "\n",
        "In IRL, instead of directly learning the policy, the goal is to infer the reward function $R(s, a)$ that the expert is optimizing. Once the reward function is estimated, standard reinforcement learning techniques can be used to find the policy.\n",
