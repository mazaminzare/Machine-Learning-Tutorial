        "\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) integrates human guidance into the reinforcement learning process to improve the performance and safety of learned policies. This approach leverages human feedback to guide the agent's learning process, making it particularly useful in complex and high-stakes environments where purely autonomous learning may be insufficient.\n",

        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent interacting with an environment $\\mathcal{E}$, modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The MDP is defined by the tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}, r, \\gamma)$, where:\n",
        "- $\\mathcal{S}$ is the state space.\n",
        "- $\\mathcal{A}$ is the action space.\n",
        "- $\\mathcal{P}(s'|s, a)$ is the state transition probability.\n",
        "- $r(s, a)$ is the reward function.\n",
        "- $\\gamma \\in [0, 1)$ is the discount factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent's goal is to learn a policy $\\pi(a|s)$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward:\n",

        "### Human Feedback\n",
        "\n",
        "In RLHF, human feedback is incorporated to guide the learning process. Human feedback can come in various forms, such as:\n",
        "- **Preferences**: Comparisons between two trajectories.\n",
        "- **Demonstrations**: Expert trajectories.\n",
        "- **Scalar Rewards**: Direct feedback on actions or states.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preference-Based RLHF\n",
        "\n",
        "One common form of RLHF is preference-based, where a human provides preferences between pairs of trajectories. Given two trajectories $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$, the human provides a preference indicating which trajectory is better. This preference is used to shape the reward function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reward Modeling from Preferences\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a set of human preferences $\\mathcal{D}_H = \\{(\\tau_1^i, \\tau_2^i, \\mu^i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, where $\\mu^i$ indicates the human's preference between $\\tau_1^i$ and $\\tau_2^i$, the goal is to learn a reward model $r_\\phi(s, a)$ parameterized by $\\phi$.\n",

        "\n",
