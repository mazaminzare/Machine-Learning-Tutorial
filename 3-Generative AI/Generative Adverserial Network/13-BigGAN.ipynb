        "# Comprehensive Tutorial on BigGAN\n",
        "\n",
        "BigGAN is an advanced variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that focuses on producing high-fidelity images. It was introduced by Brock, Donahue, and Simonyan in their 2018 paper \"Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis.\" BigGAN leverages large-scale training and architectural innovations to achieve state-of-the-art results in image synthesis.\n",

        "## Mathematical Foundations\n",
        "\n",
        "### Generator (G)\n",
        "\n",
        "The generator takes a random noise vector $(\\mathbf{z})$ from a prior distribution $(p_{\\mathbf{z}})$ and a class label embedding $(\\mathbf{y})$ and maps them to the data space $(G(\\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{y}; \\theta_G))$. The generator's objective is to generate data that resembles the true data distribution $(p_{\\text{data}})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discriminator (D)\n",
        "\n",
        "The discriminator takes a data sample (either real or generated) along with its class label and outputs a scalar $(D(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}; \\theta_D))$ representing the probability that the sample is real. The discriminator's objective is to correctly classify real and generated samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective function for BigGAN is similar to the standard GAN, but includes class conditioning:\n",

        "\n",
        "The training of BigGAN involves the following steps, typically repeated iteratively:\n",
