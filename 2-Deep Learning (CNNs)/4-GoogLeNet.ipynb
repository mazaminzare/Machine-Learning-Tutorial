        "\n",
        "The Inception model, initially introduced as GoogLeNet (Inception v1), has undergone several iterations, each aiming to improve on its predecessor in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and ease of training. Here's a detailed look at each variant:\n",

        "\n",
        "**Innovations**:\n",
        "- **Inception Modules**: Combines multiple kernel sizes in one module to extract features at various scales.\n",
        "- **1x1 Convolutions**: Used for dimensionality reduction and channel depth reduction before more expensive 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions.\n",
        "\n",
