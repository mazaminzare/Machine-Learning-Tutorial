        "# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A Comprehensive Tutorial with Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture designed to model long-range dependencies and overcome the vanishing gradient problem common in traditional RNNs. LSTMs are widely used in various sequence modeling tasks, including natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it challenging to capture long-range dependencies in sequences. LSTM networks address this issue by introducing a memory cell and three gating mechanisms that control the flow of information through the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. LSTM Cell Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "An LSTM cell consists of several components:\n",
        "1. **Cell State ($C_t$):** The memory of the cell that carries information across time steps.\n",
        "2. **Hidden State ($h_t$):** The output of the LSTM cell at each time step.\n",
        "3. **Gates:** Three gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell state.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Forget Gate\n",
        "\n",
        "The forget gate decides which information to discard from the cell state. It takes the previous hidden state ($h_{t-1}$) and the current input ($x_t$) and applies a sigmoid function:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)\n",
