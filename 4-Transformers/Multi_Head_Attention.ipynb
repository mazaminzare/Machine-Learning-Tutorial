        "# Multi-Head Attention: A Comprehensive Tutorial with Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-Head Attention** is a key component of the Transformer architecture, introduced in the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, improving its ability to capture dependencies and relationships in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "In sequence modeling tasks, it is crucial to capture dependencies between elements of the sequence, regardless of their distance. Traditional RNNs and LSTMs capture these dependencies sequentially, which can be inefficient. Self-attention mechanisms, such as Multi-Head Attention, provide a more efficient way to model these dependencies by allowing the model to attend to multiple positions in the sequence at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Multi-Head Attention Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Input Representations\n",
        "\n",
        "The input to the Multi-Head Attention mechanism consists of three matrices:\n",
        "1. **Query ($Q$)**\n",
        "2. **Key ($K$)**\n",
        "3. **Value ($V$)**\n",
        "\n",
        "These matrices are obtained by multiplying the input sequence matrix ($X$) by learned weight matrices $W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$ respectively:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Q = XW_Q, \\quad K = XW_K, \\quad V = XW_V\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2. Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of the attention mechanism is the Scaled Dot-Product Attention. It computes the attention scores by taking the dot product of the query and key matrices, scaling by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors, and applying a softmax function to obtain the attention weights:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors. The scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_k}$ helps in stabilizing the gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3. Multi-Head Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of performing a single attention function, Multi-Head Attention runs multiple attention heads in parallel. Each head has its own set of learned weight matrices, and their outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\ldots, \\text{head}_h)W_O\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where each attention head is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_{Q_i}, KW_{K_i}, VW_{V_i})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "And $W_O$ is an output projection matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Multi-Head Attention Equations Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, the Multi-Head Attention mechanism can be expressed with the following equations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compute Query, Key, and Value matrices:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Q = XW_Q, \\quad K = XW_K, \\quad V = XW_V\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Scaled Dot-Product Attention for each head:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_{Q_i}, KW_{K_i}, VW_{V_i}) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{(QW_{Q_i})(KW_{K_i})^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) VW_{V_i}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Concatenate the heads and project the output:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\ldots, \\text{head}_h)W_O\n",
        "$$\n",
