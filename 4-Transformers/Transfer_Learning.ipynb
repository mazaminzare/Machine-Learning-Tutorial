        "# Transfer Learning: A Comprehensive Tutorial with Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transfer Learning** is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is adapted to a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be time-consuming and require a large amount of data, transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from a previously trained model on a large dataset to improve the performance on a smaller, task-specific dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Training deep neural networks typically requires large amounts of labeled data and computational resources. Transfer learning addresses these challenges by reusing a pre-trained model, which has already learned useful features from a large dataset. This approach is particularly beneficial in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Transfer Learning Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several techniques for transfer learning, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "In feature extraction, the pre-trained model is used as a fixed feature extractor. The pre-trained model's convolutional base (in the case of CNNs) is retained, and a new classifier is trained on top of it for the target task.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Freeze the Convolutional Base:** The weights of the convolutional layers are frozen to prevent them from being updated during training.\n",
        "2. **Add a New Classifier:** A new fully connected layer (or layers) is added on top of the frozen base to perform the target task.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2. Fine-Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "In fine-tuning, the pre-trained model is slightly modified, and its parameters are updated during training. Typically, only the later layers are unfrozen and fine-tuned, while the initial layers remain frozen.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unfreeze Some Layers:** Selectively unfreeze the later layers of the pre-trained model.\n",
        "2. **Train with a Lower Learning Rate:** Fine-tune the model using a smaller learning rate to prevent large updates that could destroy the learned features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3. Using Pre-Trained Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Many popular pre-trained models, such as VGG, ResNet, and BERT, are available for various tasks. These models can be used directly or adapted for specific tasks using feature extraction or fine-tuning techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Mathematical Formulation\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1. Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a pre-trained model $M_{pre}$ and a new dataset $D_{new}$, the feature extraction process involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Forward Pass through Pre-Trained Model:** Pass the input $x$ from $D_{new}$ through the pre-trained model to obtain features $f$:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f = M_{pre}(x)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Train New Classifier:** Use the extracted features $f$ to train a new classifier $C_{new}$ with weights $W_{new}$:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "y = C_{new}(f) = W_{new} \\cdot f\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2. Fine-Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "In fine-tuning, the pre-trained model $M_{pre}$ is partially updated. Let $W_{pre}$ represent the weights of the pre-trained model, and $W_{new}$ represent the weights of the new classifier. The fine-tuning process involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Update Select Layers:** Unfreeze and update a subset of $W_{pre}$ (denoted as $W_{pre}'$) along with $W_{new}$ during training:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{minimize} \\quad L(y_{true}, y_{pred}; W_{pre}', W_{new})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $L$ is the loss function, $y_{true}$ is the true label, and $y_{pred}$ is the predicted label.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Key Properties of Transfer Learning\n",
