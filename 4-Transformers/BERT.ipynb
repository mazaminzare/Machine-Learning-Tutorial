        "# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A Comprehensive Tutorial with Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "**BERT** is a transformer-based model introduced by Google in the paper \"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.\" BERT's primary innovation is its ability to generate deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This makes BERT highly effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional NLP models, such as RNNs and LSTMs, often process text in a unidirectional manner, limiting their ability to capture context effectively. BERT overcomes this limitation by utilizing the Transformer architecture, which allows for bidirectional context representation. This approach enables BERT to achieve state-of-the-art results in many NLP benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Transformer Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT is built on the Transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. The Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder, but BERT only uses the encoder part.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Encoder Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The encoder in BERT consists of multiple layers, each containing two main components:\n",
        "1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** This mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.\n",
        "2. **Feed-Forward Neural Network:** A fully connected network that processes the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2. Input Representation\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT uses a combination of token embeddings, segment embeddings, and position embeddings to represent the input text. The input representation is a sum of these three embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Input Embedding} = \\text{Token Embedding} + \\text{Segment Embedding} + \\text{Position Embedding}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. BERT Pre-training\n",
        "\n",
        "BERT is pre-trained using two unsupervised tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\n",
        "\n",
        "In MLM, a certain percentage of the input tokens are masked, and the model is trained to predict these masked tokens. This helps the model learn bidirectional context.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "L_{\\text{MLM}} = -\\sum_{t \\in \\text{masked tokens}} \\log P(t | X_{\\backslash t})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $X_{\\backslash t}$ represents the input sequence with the token $t$ masked out.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\n",
        "\n",
        "In NSP, the model is trained to predict whether a given pair of sentences appears consecutively in the original text. This helps BERT understand the relationship between sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "L_{\\text{NSP}} = -\\sum \\left[ y \\log P(\\text{isNext}) + (1 - y) \\log P(\\text{isNotNext}) \\right]\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $y$ is a binary label indicating if the second sentence follows the first one in the original text.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Fine-Tuning BERT\n",
        "\n",
        "After pre-training, BERT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by adding a task-specific layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model. The entire model, including BERT, is fine-tuned jointly on the task-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1. Fine-Tuning Process\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Task-Specific Layer:** Add a task-specific layer (e.g., a classification layer for text classification tasks) on top of BERT.\n",
        "2. **Joint Training:** Fine-tune the entire model on the task-specific dataset using supervised learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2. Fine-Tuning Example\n",
        "\n",
        "For text classification, a simple classifier can be added on top of the [CLS] token's final hidden state:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "y = \\text{softmax}(W \\cdot h_{[\\text{CLS}]})\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $h_{[\\text{CLS}]}$ is the final hidden state of the [CLS] token, and $W$ is the weight matrix for the classification layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Key Properties of BERT\n",

        "BERT has several key properties that make it powerful for NLP tasks:\n",
