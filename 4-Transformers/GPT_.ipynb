        "# GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): A Comprehensive Tutorial with Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "**Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)** is a type of Transformer model designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Developed by OpenAI, GPT is known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. The key innovation of GPT is its two-stage training process: unsupervised pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by supervised fine-tuning on specific tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Background and Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional NLP models often require extensive task-specific data and training. GPT addresses this challenge by first pre-training a Transformer model on a vast amount of text data, enabling it to learn a wide range of language patterns and structures. This pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned on specific tasks with relatively small amounts of labeled data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. GPT Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture of GPT is based on the Transformer model, specifically the decoder part of the Transformer. The key components include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**\n",
        "2. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**\n",
        "3. **Positional Encoding**\n",
        "4. **Layer Normalization**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1. Self-Attention Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other. The scaled dot-product attention is used:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $Q$ is the query matrix.\n",
        "- $K$ is the key matrix.\n",
        "- $V$ is the value matrix.\n",
        "- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2. Multi-Head Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "GPT uses multi-head attention to allow the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\ldots, \\text{head}_h)W_O\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3. Feed-Forward Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "Each attention head output is passed through a feed-forward neural network:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{FFN}(x) = \\max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2.4. Positional Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the Transformer model does not inherently capture the order of the words, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings:\n",

        "### 3.2. Fine-Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "After pre-training, GPT is fine-tuned on specific tasks using task-specific data and objectives. The fine-tuning adjusts the model weights to optimize performance on the target task.\n",
        "\n",
